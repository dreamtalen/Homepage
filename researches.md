## Short Path Padding Technique Design

*Supervised by Prof. Weifeng He, Shanghai Jiao Tong University*

- Designed and implemented a short path padding software system employing integer linear programming method, which supports up to a wide pulse of 1/3 cycle time in pulsed-latch pipelines.
- Proposed step-by-step based and path group based schemes to reduce up to 80.9% runtime of the baseline padding algorithm and used multiple-Vt buffer cells to reduce additional hardware cost by 52.3%, on average.

## Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit(3D-IC) Partitioning Technique Design

*Supervised by Prof. Weifeng He, Shanghai Jiao Tong University*

*Excellent Graduate Thesis Award in Department of Nano-microelectronics*

- Designed a 3D-IC partitioning algorithm for motion estimation(ME) module of HEVC, including the initial partition algorithm based on breath first search and the iterative optimization algorithm. 
- Designed and implemented a partitioning algorithm evaluation platform which that has functions including a netlist file parser, analyzing area reports, modeling circuits with hyper-graph data structures, applying partitioning algorithms, and evaluating partition results by the area utilization rate and cut edges number.
- Achieved an optimum partition for the ME module, which reduced 43% of the cut edges while the area utilization rate reached 96%.
